# Why another network?
## Centralization of basic services
The current WWW landscape is centralized. Most people use the same
search engine (Google Search), the same video sharing platform (YouTube),
the same social network (Facebook) etc.. This approach has its issues:
- its optimized for project commercialization, not for promoting small and
independent creative endeavours
- freedom of speech is being progressively limited
- users are subjected to invasive profiling and tracking in order to maximize
ad revenue at the cost of user privacy
